# Wolfe Glitcher

My personal playground for making web-based glitch art tools. Built in React.

# Tools

## Text Glitcher

![UI Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoboe/wolfe-glitcher/main/docs/textglitch-v1.jpg)

This tool is designed for what some call "Notepad Glitching". Upload an image and it will appear beside its raw HEX data in a text field. Watch the image as you make changes to the text to see your glitches in real time!

Note: For the most reliable results, it is highly suggested to screenshot your glitched images instead of saving them directly! There is a high probability that saved images will not open on your computer.

Currently supports:
- JPEG Images only
- HEX Image Encoding

Todo's:
- Add support for other image types (PNG, BMP, TIFF, etc)
- Add dropdowns for different text encodings (I.E. ASCII)
- Overall UI Improvements
- A better text editor
- Syntax highlighting for JPEG data "chunks"

## Audio Glitcher

Coming soon! This tool is designed for Image Sonification, AKA editing images with audio tools. Intended to be more user-friendly than my previous tool, "[Audacity Glitcher](https://github.com/zoboe/audacity-glitcher)".
